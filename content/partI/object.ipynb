    "-   Process oriented: emphasize the actions performed\n",
    "-   Programs emphasize one or the other but not both\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Object-oriented** methodology\n",
    "-   Data and processes given equal importance\n",
    "-   **Objects** combine:\n",

    "\n",
    "-   OOP scales very nicely with the complexity found in most large\n",

    "#### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "-   OOP gives us an approach where we can think about the problem more\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Build a regression tool that the user can apply to estimate linear\n",

    "The **procedural abstraction** would go something like this:\n",

    "> -   estimate models\n",

    "> -   Variables can perform operations on themselves (summary stats,\n",
    ">     spatial lag, etc.)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We are not concerned with whether we use dictionaries, tuples, lists\n",
    "> or something else as data structures for the variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Abstraction Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Abstraction is very powerful if you use it consistently.\n",
    "-   Abstraction let's you focus on the problem domain rather than the\n",
    "    programming domain.\n",
    "-   Abstraction allows you to focus on **design** rather than\n",
    "    **implementation**\n",
    "-   You should not use words like tuple, dictionary, list, etc when\n",
    "    doing abstraction and design. (otherwise you are\n",
    "    doing implementation).\n",
    "-   Once you start implementation, you go from putty to clay.\n",
    "-   Clay is brittle.\n",

    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It provides information hiding\n",
    "-   Objects encapsulate data and procedures for manipulating that data\n",
    "-   Objects **hide** the details of the implementation from the user of\n",
    "    the objects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why, what are the benefits?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Conceptual independence: user is loosely coupled with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > -   Doesn't matter if implementation changes\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Physical independence: behavior of the object is determined by the\n",
    "    object itself\n",
    "\n",
    "    > -   No unwanted side-effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Oriented Design and OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented design (OOD) does not necessarily require that we use an\n",
    "object-oriented programming language to implement our design\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use a structured language such as C to implement our design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OO Design\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is about designing **objects** and how those objects **interact**\n",
    "> with themselves and each other to provide the functionality required\n",
    "> for the system\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The world of OOD is rich with **design patterns**. These are general\n",
    "solutions to problems that commonly confront the developer of a new\n",
    "system.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Patterns represent different cases of recurring types of object\n",
    "    interactions\n",
    "-   Communal knowledge\n",
    "-   Origins in architecture: Christopher Alexander (A Timeless Way\n",
    "    of Building)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](figures/ca.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Bible* of design patterns is the **Gang of Four** book:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](figures/gang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### OO Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Derivation, Inheritance, Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivation:\n",
    "\n",
    ":   The creation of subclasses, which are new classes which retain the\n",
    "    data and functionality of the existing class, but permit additional\n",
    "    modificatin and customization\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    ":   How attributes of a parent class are passed down to offspring\n",
    "    classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    ":   Multiple generations of derivation. Think taxonomies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](figures/itree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Describes all the traits a subclass shares with its ancestor classes.\n",
    "Subclasses are considered to have an *is-a* relationship to the ancestor\n",
    "class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: a polygon *is a* type of geometric shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The subclasses can add additional functionality/characteristics to what\n",
    "they inherit from the parent classes. This provides a mechanism to\n",
    "achieve granularity in your designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: a polygon is a shape, but it may have properties that other shapes\n",
    "don't have, such as a perimeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Describes how objects can be manipulated and accessed using attributes\n",
    "and behaviors they have in common without regard to their specific\n",
    "class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen examples of polymorphism in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> x=5\n",
    "    >>> l=range(3)\n",
    "    >>> x*3\n",
    "    15\n",
    "    >>> l*3\n",
    "    [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n",
    "    >>> \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to build new classes using existing classes. Composition is\n",
    "appropriate when the new class we are building displays a *has-a*\n",
    "relationship to existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ex: A map has a legend. An x-y plot may have a legend. Other graphics\n",
    "> might have legends. Let's make a legend class to abstract this out\n",
    "> rather than putting it in a View class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition allows us to define small scoped classes. We can build up\n",
    "complex classes by aggregating/combining these smaller classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes (ok, many times) much easier than designing the perfect\n",
    "abstract class to cover all cases and relying on inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Orientation in Python\n",

    "### Big Picture\n",

    "> -   From inception (not afterthought)\n",
    "> -   Everything is an object\n",
    "> -   Everything does not have to be OO\n",
    "> -   Can mix and match functional and OO in python\n",
    "\n",
    "> **warning**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Everything is not a nail\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Class = data structure\n",
    "-   Instance = variable of that structure type\n",
    "-   Classes have:\n",
    "\n",

    "    > -   attributes = characteristics (variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analogy, think about cookies (the kind you eat). A cookie cutter\n",
    "is the class, and when you press it into the dough, the resulting cookie\n",
    "is an instance of the class. Classes are like blueprints, instances are\n",
    "the realizations of those blueprints.\n"
